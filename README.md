### Hello, I'm Ash Eastham! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent university graduate who enjoys web design and devlopment, based in Leeds, UK.

I have a good understanding of front-end technologies/design and I'm currently looking to expand my skillset to become an all round better developer.  I have used some back-end technologies such as PHP, Laravel, MySQL etc and I now want to get more in-depth with web development to gain a better understanding of the work I've completed.

### What I'm Focusing On

I'm currently getting more in-depth with JavaScript and JS libraries/frameworks.  My aim currently is to master JavaScript including ES6 and then to move onto things like React and maybe some back-end stuff with Node, or some other framework.  I'm always trying to learn new things, whether it be coding, or just something interesting on YouTube or other websites.  

### A Little About Myself

I'm 23 years old and have been into computers since my grandparents got my first laptop when I was 7.  I'm very interested in computers, music, graphics/design, video and much more.  I enjoy DJing and also want to start learning music production.  Otherwise, I'm a uni graduate trying to find my place in the working world!
